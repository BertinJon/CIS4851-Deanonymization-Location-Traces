This code outputs a file called externaltraj.txt for the createInput code.

The code created a quadrilateral around the main part of Michigan (UP is not included). Then a random location is generated and checked to make sure it is inside the quadrilateral. If it is inside the quadrilateral then the external trajectory is saved to the externaltraj.txt file.
